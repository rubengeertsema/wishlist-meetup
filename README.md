# Meetup Continuous Deployment to Kubernetes

Welcome to the git repo for this meetup. During this meetup we will deploy a simple application to a Kubernetes 
cluster. We will also build a fully automated build pipeline that will deploy the frontend of our application to 
Kubernetes.

All assignments/steps for this meetup are present on 3 branches:
* 1-deploy-backend 
* 2-deploy-frontend
* 3-build-pipeline

Start with the first branch and move to the next when done. The end result can be viewed on the branch named `complete`. 
Good luck and do not hesitate to ask for help!
